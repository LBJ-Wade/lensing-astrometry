This notebook accompagnies the paper, [Birrer & Treu 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10965), "Astrometric requirements for strong lensing time-delay cosmography", arXiv 1904.10965.
We write the Equations presented in the paper in python and produce plots and numbers presented in Birrer & Treu 2019.
The lensing computations are performed with [lenstronomy](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy) and we provide convenient definitions to compute astrometric requirements for different lenses.
